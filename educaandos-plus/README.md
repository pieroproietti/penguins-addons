# EducaAndOS-plus

A theme for eggs, let you to save your time.

An eggs theme is simply an organized set of files and directories, YAML being the most widely used.

EducaAndOS is the first example of an external eggs theme available, previous themes: neon, ufficiozero, telos and waydroid will be via, via moved out of eggs itself and updated to the present configurations.

We currently have the following directories:
* applications
* artwork
* calamares
* livecd

## applications
Just a desktop link, will be copied to ```/usr/share/applications/``` and on the Desktop.

## artwork
The icon for your desktop link, will be copied on ```/usr/share/icons/```

## calamares
Contain the calamares customizations and it's by far the most important.

Each sample configuration file contains documentation on the options it contains.

The configuration of calamares is specified in yaml files and contains within it documentation for the various options. The main calamares ```settings.conf``` file is automatically created by eggs, only partition, locale and users are used here.

Of course, the reference information is in the [calamares repository](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/) and on the [calamares.io](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/Deploy-Configuration) website
